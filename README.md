# Interface Guide
The interface is split into two parts:
- **Node Canvas**: Located on the left, it includes buttons related to node editing.
- **Rendering Space**: Located on the right, it displays the rendered results.

A divider separates the two parts, and you can adjust this for fullscreen modes (GIFs to follow for these features).

  The Mini-Map is located at the bottom-right and shows all the nodes in the canvas, the bottom-left side has controls for the minimap such as zoom level and locking the canvas. The minimap is also pannable.
